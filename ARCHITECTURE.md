# Architecture

This file describes how Pitboard's code is organised and what must stay true in it. It
also holds the measured facts the design rests on, about macOS, WebKit, Claude Code,
OpenAI's Codex CLI and the sites the app's account windows open. It changes when the layout
changes or a tool build moves a fact, not with each commit.

## Bird's eye view

Pitboard switches Claude Code, Codex or Claude Desktop between a person's own accounts on
one machine. It also shows how much of each account's limits is left. A switch parks the
login in use and puts another account's parked login in its place.

One crate, `pitboard-core`, does this for every tool. It reads and writes each tool's login,
keeps Pitboard's index of accounts, and asks each tool's service for usage. Claude Code's and
Codex's logins are credentials, a keychain item or a file. Claude Desktop's is a list of
items in its data folder, moved by rename.

Two front ends use the core: the command line, `pitboard`, on macOS and Linux, and the menu
bar app on macOS 14 or later. The app calls the core through UniFFI bindings. The command
line inside the app is what the app's daily renewal runs, and what the `pitboard-app` cask
puts on `PATH`.

The app also gives each enrolled account a window on its tool's site, claude.ai or
chatgpt.com, where the site's own pages run in WebKit. The windows take the list of
accounts from the core, and nothing else. [Account windows](#account-windows) describes
them.

Pitboard has no server of its own. The core sends requests only to Anthropic, for Claude
Code, to OpenAI, for Codex, and to claude.ai, for Claude Desktop's live usage once somebody
turns it on. An account's window loads its site, and whatever the site's pages load, as a
browser would.

## Code map

- `crates/pitboard-core`: the engine. Parking, switching, recovery, the stores and usage.
  The front ends reach it through `service::Pitboard`, built with a `context::Context`.
  - `provider/`: one module per tool, `claude`, `codex` and `desktop`, each implementing
    the `Provider` trait in `provider/mod.rs`. The trait covers where the tool keeps its
    login, whose it is, how to renew it, what it has left and what its sign-in prints,
    which `provider::sign_in_view` reads for both apps. Each module's `assumptions.rs` is
    that tool's register of facts. `provider/codex/holders.rs` names where a running
    `codex` can be, and what makes each take a switch. `provider/printed.rs` reads what a
    tool printed as a terminal does: the text it shows, and where each hyperlink goes.
  - `provider/desktop/`: Claude Desktop. Its login is a `TreeLogin`, not a credential, so
    every credential operation of `Provider` is an error there. `paths.rs` names the items
    a switch moves, `config.rs` the three account keys of `config.json`, `cookies.rs` says
    whose session the cookie jar holds without decrypting it, and `identity.rs` says whose
    a data folder is. `holders.rs` is what holds the folder while Claude runs.
    `history.rs` reads the app's own usage history. `safe_storage.rs`, `crypto.rs`,
    `web.rs` and `live_usage.rs` are live usage, the only code that reads Claude's key.
  - `holder.rs`: what keeps a tool's login in memory while it runs, told apart by where
    its program runs from. A switch's warning, `doctor` and the app's offer to quit an app
    all read it, so they cannot disagree.
  - `host/`: the machine, behind one seam. The `Host` trait is what a test replaces: the
    system's store of secrets, files, the vault, this user's processes and the scheduler,
    reached through `Context` and faked by `host/memory.rs`. `fs`, `proc` and `user` are
    plain functions for what the system does whoever asks: private files and directories,
    whether a process is alive, the login name, and the `PATH` the person's login shell
    builds, which `unix/shell.rs` asks for. `program.rs` finds a program the way the
    system's launcher does. `mod.rs` chooses the system, once: `macos/` (the keychain
    through `security`, `ps`, launchd) or `linux/` (`/proc`, systemd), each with what
    `unix/` holds for both. A fact that differs by system is a `match` on `host::OS`, such
    as the folders macOS asks about before an app may look in them.
  - `host/` also reads what Claude Desktop needs of the machine. `bundle.rs` tells which
    processes run from inside an app bundle, by one rule for every system's process list.
    On macOS the host reads the cookie jar with `/usr/bin/sqlite3` in `macos/sqlite.rs`, a
    bundle's version with `plutil`, and `Claude Safe Storage` in `macos/safe_storage.rs`,
    through `security`.
    Linux has no Claude Desktop, so there each of these finds nothing.
  - `store/`: reading and writing logins, whichever store holds them: the chain rules, a
    file, the vault of files and the stores in memory the tests use. On macOS, parked
    logins are keychain items. On Linux, they are files in the vault. `store/tree.rs`
    moves a tree login's items, only by `rename` on one volume, checked by inode, and
    deletes nothing but a park.
  - `switch/`: every change to Pitboard's index (switching, enrolling, adopting, renaming,
    forgetting, renewing, repairing, abandoning and uninstalling), and the journal that
    finishes an interrupted switch. `switch/tree.rs` is a Claude Desktop switch, enrolment
    and sign-out, and `switch/tree_journal.rs` its own record,
    `~/.pitboard/desktop/journal.json`, which finishes or undoes an interrupted one.
  - `state.rs`: `state.json`, the index of accounts and where each one's login is parked.
  - `lock.rs`: the lock Claude Code takes around credential writes, taken the same way.
  - `context.rs`: what the core takes from its environment, read from a map of variables
    by the same code for every front end, apart from the `PATH` that `host/linux` reads to
    find the program daily renewal runs.
  - `app.rs`: what an app finds for itself that a command typed at a prompt is given: each
    tool's program, on the login shell's `PATH` and then where the tool's installers put
    it, and the `pitboard` a terminal would run.
  - `api.rs`: the requests to Anthropic. The requests to OpenAI are in
    `provider/codex/api.rs`.
  - `status.rs`, `doctor.rs`, `statusline.rs` and `schedule.rs` serve the commands of the
    same names. `schedule.rs` decides what daily renewal runs and whose it is; the host's
    scheduler writes it.
  - `words.rs`: the sentences and column words Pitboard says in more than one place, each
    a function of typed values: spans of time, a limit's names, when it resets, how long an
    account lasts, a parked login's life, a renewal run and doctor's summary. It also holds
    `usage_level`, the steps at which a limit's colour changes. A thing said both in a
    column and in a sentence has a function for each form. The command line calls these
    functions directly, and the macOS app calls the ones it shows through `pitboard-ffi`.
    Clock times are not in it.
- `crates/pitboard`: the command line. Arguments, rendering for people, the man page, and
  the `--json` contract, pinned by the snapshots in `crates/pitboard/tests/snapshots`.
- `crates/pitboard-ffi`: the core as UniFFI bindings, for the apps: a static library for
  the macOS app, a dynamic one for the Windows app.
  - `sites.rs` gives both apps `pitboard-sites`' sites and links as records of their own,
    and says a site's sign-in steps as a window on this system can follow them: a window on
    a Mac cannot use a passkey.
  - `account_windows/` holds the rules of an account's window that each app's web code
    asks as its engine asks it: which accounts have a window and the store each one's data
    is kept in (`stores.rs`, `accounts.rs`), where a page may go and what becomes of a
    response (`policy.rs`), what a window says (`notes.rs`), what a page may do and how its
    dialogs say who asks (`pages.rs`), and what a download is called (`downloads.rs`). What
    differs by system there, such as how a copy of a file is numbered, which names are one
    file, or an alert's "on this Mac", is a `match` on `host::OS`, as what a window cannot
    sign in with is in `sites.rs`.
- `crates/pitboard-sites`: the sites an account's window opens, and what a link from outside
  may be. A leaf, with no I/O and nothing of the core, whose one dependency is `url`, for
  IDNA alone.
  - `site.rs` declares each site as values: its host, the tool whose accounts it serves and
    the hosts that redirect to it. The hosts its sign-in goes to, the hosts it blocks, its
    sign-in paths, its store name, its sign-in steps and whether its sign-in offers a
    passkey are values too. Nothing else names a site, so a site is added to `ALL`, with its
    fixture page and tests.
  - `link.rs` checks a link from outside: a site's own host or alias, over `https`, with no
    port or user information, and never a sign-in path. `LinkRefusal` says why one is
    refused, in the sentence every front end shows.
  - `handoff.rs` writes and reads the Pitboard link, `<scheme>://open?url=<link>`.
  - `address.rs` splits a link as Foundation's `URLComponents` does, which is how the macOS
    app read one before the rule was Rust. [Foundation's URLs](#foundations-urls) has what
    was measured.
  - `web.rs` reads a page's address, for an account window's rules, as Foundation's `URL`
    does: its scheme, and the host, port and user it names, with the host a request goes
    to.
- `crates/pitboard-share-ffi`: `pitboard-sites` as UniFFI bindings for the macOS Share
  extension alone, a static library with one function, `share_link`. It checks a shared
  page and writes the Pitboard link that hands it to the app, or says why not in the
  sentence the app shows. It holds nothing of the core.
- `crates/uniffi-bindgen-swift` and `crates/uniffi-bindgen-csharp`: generate the Swift and
  the C# bindings with exactly the UniFFI version the library uses. The bindings check
  method checksums when they load. The C# generator is NordSecurity's, pinned to a release
  built against that UniFFI; it is a build tool, so `deny.toml` leaves it out of the graph.
  Every type the core's bindings export is declared in `pitboard-ffi`, because the C#
  generator cannot use a type from another crate. `pitboard-share-ffi`, which only Swift
  reads, declares its own.
- `crates/pitboard-conformance`: checks a tool's register against a build of that tool.
- `apps/`: the native apps, one directory for each system.
- `apps/windows/`: the Windows app. `Pitboard.Core` is the core's C# bindings as an
  assembly of their own, generated into `Generated/` and not committed, and
  `Pitboard.Core.Tests` calls the core through them.
- `apps/macos/`: the menu bar app. The Swift package holds it as libraries its tests load
  without starting it. `PitboardKit` calls the bindings off the main thread,
  `PitboardShareBindings` is `pitboard-share-ffi`'s, for the Share extension,
  `PitboardLinkTarget` is where a Pitboard link goes, which the app and the extension both
  link, and `PitboardApp` is everything the app does. The account windows are mapped under
  [Account windows](#account-windows).
  - `project.yml` is the app itself, the spec XcodeGen generates `Pitboard.xcodeproj`
    from. Its `Pitboard` target in `App` starts `PitboardApp` and adds Sparkle, and
    `PitboardUITests` in `UITests` drives it. `PitboardShare`, from `ShareExtension`, is the
    Share extension the app embeds. Only the project's `Package.resolved` is committed,
    which pins Sparkle's revision.
  - A renewal schedule written by an app up to 0.3.0 starts the app with `renew`.
    `App/Main.swift` then replaces the process with the command line inside the app.
  - `scripts/build-xcframework.sh` builds the core, as `PitboardFFI.xcframework`, and
    `pitboard-share-ffi`, as `PitboardShareFFI.xcframework`, each with its Swift bindings,
    for both Mac architectures. `scripts/build-app.sh` generates the project and builds
    `Pitboard.app` with `xcodebuild`, with the command line inside at
    `Contents/Helpers/pitboard`.
- `packaging/`: the files a release writes into the tap `datlechin/homebrew-tap`. They are
  the casks `pitboard.rb` for the command line and `pitboard-app.rb` for the app,
  `tap_migrations.json`, and the tap's README.
- `docs/`: the Mintlify source of docs.usepitboard.com.
- `website/`: reserved for the usepitboard.com site, to be built with Astro; empty.
- `.github/`:
  - `workflows/ci.yml` checks every push to `main` and every pull request, and
    `workflows/release.yml` turns a `v` tag into a release.
  - `workflows/conformance.yml` checks each tool's newest build against its register.
  - `workflows/sparkle.yml` opens an issue when Sparkle has a release newer than the one
    `apps/macos/project.yml` pins, because Dependabot cannot read that pin.
  - `actions/xcodegen` puts the pinned XcodeGen on `PATH` for every job that builds the
    app.
  - `workflows/rotation.yml` rehearses rotating the update key.
  - `actions/apple-keychain` imports the Developer ID certificate for every job that signs.
  - `scripts/` holds the EdDSA key and signature helpers, and the scripts that add Sparkle,
    the command line and the Share extension's library to the app's bill of materials.
  - `dependabot.yml` asks for weekly updates of Cargo dependencies and GitHub Actions.

## Invariants

- The core prints nothing.
- The core reads its environment in `Context::read`, from a map of variables, the same way
  for every front end. The command line passes its own through `Context::from_env`. An app
  passes the one it was started with through `AppContext::discover`, which also asks the
  person's login shell for `PATH`, because an app the system started has none of a
  shell's.
- Three variables are also read straight from the process. `PATH` is read when a context
  made with `Context::new` was given no search path (`context.rs`), and on Linux to find
  the program daily renewal runs (`host/linux`). `NO_COLOR` is read by the status line
  (`pitboard/src/main.rs`). `XPC_SERVICE_NAME`, which launchd sets, is read in
  `host/macos/launchd.rs`. `clippy.toml` refuses `std::env::var`, `var_os`, `vars` and
  `vars_os` outside `context.rs`, so every other read carries an `#[allow]` that says why
  it is meant.
- `READ` in `context.rs` and `settings::OVERRIDING_ENV` name every variable Pitboard
  reads, and `Environment` refuses, in a build with debug assertions, to read one they do
  not name. The integration tests withhold every one of them from each command they run,
  except `HOME` and `USER`, and the core's unit tests make their context with
  `Context::for_unit_test`, which withholds all of them, so a variable exported where
  `cargo test` runs, such as `PITBOARD_CLAUDE`, never reaches a test.
- Which system Pitboard runs on is decided in `host/mod.rs` and nowhere else. Anything
  that differs by system is either the host's to answer or a `match` on `host::OS`, so a
  system added to `host::Os` does not compile until it is said for every one.
- No test starts the person's own login shell. A test names a shell of its own in `SHELL`,
  one that is not there, or hands in what a shell said.
- A test never reaches the system's own scheduler. A test context schedules through
  `MemoryHost`, which writes the files in the test's home and asks no service manager, and
  the real hosts refuse to ask launchd or systemd from a unit test at all.
- `pitboard-ffi` exports records, enums, two error types, free functions and two objects,
  `SignIn` and `Pitboard`. A call to an object is synchronous and may block on the keychain,
  a lock, the network or the person's login shell, and `PitboardKit` makes each off the main
  thread; making a `Pitboard` blocks on none of them, since it reads its environment on
  first use. The free functions block on nothing, and the app makes them where it likes:
  `tools`, `sign_in_view`, the rule `same_reset` from `usage.rs`, and `usage_level` and the
  sentences and column words of `words.rs` the apps show, which read only what they are
  given; `sites`, `sites_for`, `site_names`, `site_link`, `read_pitboard_link`,
  `pitboard_link` and `link_refusal_reason`, which are `pitboard-sites`' and read only what
  they are given too; the account windows' rules, such as `store_id`, `window_accounts`,
  `decide_navigation` and `window_note`, which read only what they are given as well, so a
  web view's delegate asks them as it is asked; `download_destination`, which asks the file
  system whether each name it tries is taken; `command_line_places` and `app_command_line`,
  which only join paths; `can_run`, which asks the file system about one path; and
  `home_directory` and `pitboard_directory`, which read the environment they are given and,
  without `HOME`, this account's passwd entry. `find_command_line` looks along a search
  path, so the app makes it off the main thread.
- The app has no rule of its own for what the core decides: its home, Pitboard's directory,
  whether a path is a program, the sites and which links from outside it opens are asked of
  the core. The account windows key their records by Pitboard's directory standardised as
  Foundation standardises a file URL, as they did before the core said where it is, in
  `WebEnvironment.recordKey` alone.
- On macOS, only `/usr/bin/security` reads or writes Claude Code's keychain item and
  Pitboard's parked items. No keychain item is touched through the Security framework. The
  reason is under [macOS](#macos) in Measured facts.
- Pitboard takes Claude Code's write lock, the same way Claude Code takes it, before writing
  Claude Code's login. It writes the login where it already lives.
- Codex takes no lock on `auth.json`, so a switch reads the file again before replacing
  it. Every switch reads the live login back rather than trusting its own write.
- Pitboard never answers a failed keychain write by writing Claude Code's plaintext file.
  That demotion is Claude Code's to make.
- A Codex login is moved, never copied (`ParkSemantics::MoveOnly`). The parked login is
  read back before the incoming login is written. Codex's own sign-in and sign-out revoke
  the stored refresh token, so two usable copies of one login must never be at rest.
- No login moves until Pitboard knows whose it is. A Claude Code login's account is asked of
  Anthropic; a Codex login's is read from its ID token; a Claude Desktop login's is read
  from its files. A session Pitboard has not seen, under an account id it knows, moves only
  once the person has enrolled it again, as does a session it knows as one account's under
  another id: E4 measured sign-ins that started with no account id, not one that replaces
  the id Log out leaves behind.
- A Claude Desktop login is a fixed list of files and folders in Claude's data directory,
  and the three keys of its `config.json` that Pitboard moves with the account. Pitboard moves that list with
  `rename` and nothing else: never a copy, never the whole directory (`TreeLogin::items`).
- Nothing in Claude's data directory moves while anything runs from `Claude.app`, or from
  a bundle under another name whose main program or helper is Claude's, and the check is
  made again before every single move. A process list Pitboard cannot read counts as
  Claude running. A `SingletonLock` counts only while its pid still runs Claude's program;
  2.19675.0 keeps none (E14), so the process scan is the check that counts.
- A Claude Desktop park is a directory under `~/.pitboard/desktop/parks`, mode 0700, on
  the same volume as Claude's data directory. A move that would cross volumes is refused,
  because it would be a copy.
- Pitboard never deletes what it found in Claude's data directory. What Claude made while
  signed out goes to `~/.pitboard/desktop/strays`. Only `forget` and `uninstall` delete a
  Claude Desktop park, and only inside the parks directory.
- Whose a Claude Desktop login is, is read from files: `lastKnownAccountUuid` and a hash of
  the encrypted `sessionKey`. Switching, enrolling, identifying and verifying never read
  the keychain.
- Pitboard reads `Claude Safe Storage` only through `/usr/bin/security`, only after the
  person turned live usage on, and never writes it. Only turning live usage on may show a
  keychain prompt. Every other read gives up within 10 seconds rather than wait on one.
- A Claude Desktop park cannot be renewed. Pitboard says when it lapses rather than
  pretend to keep it alive.
- An interrupted Claude Desktop switch has its own record, `~/.pitboard/desktop/journal.json`,
  so it never blocks a Claude Code or Codex command. It is finished only while Claude is
  closed.
- Pitboard never renews the login in use. That is the tool's own job, and a second renewer
  would break it.
- Nothing outside `pitboard-core` writes Pitboard's index. Every change goes through
  `switch`, which records what it is about to do first and finishes an interrupted change
  before starting another.
- Additive writes become durable before destructive ones. A run that dies midway leaves a
  spare copy of a login, never a missing one.
- The `--json` contract changes only on purpose. A change to a snapshot is a change to the
  contract.
- The state file is read forwards only.

## Boundaries

- The core and its front ends meet at `service::Pitboard`, `context::Context` and the types
  those two return. That is the supported interface of `pitboard-core`. The other public
  modules are public only so the front ends in this repository can reach them, and may
  change in any release.
- In that interface, adding an error, warning or check code is not a breaking change.
  Renaming or removing one is. While Pitboard is at 0.x, a breaking change gets a new minor
  version, as in 0.3.0, and after 1.0 a new major version.
- Pitboard and each tool meet at the tool's register. What Pitboard relies on about a tool
  is written there, and the conformance run checks it against the tool's newest build twice
  a week.
- Pitboard and each service meet at a few requests. The list, with what each request
  carries, is in
  [What leaves your machine](https://docs.usepitboard.com/security#what-leaves-your-machine).
- Pitboard and claude.ai or chatgpt.com meet at an account's window, which a person opens.
  The site's own pages sign the window in, WebKit keeps that sign-in in the account's
  store, and Pitboard decides only where each navigation goes.
- Pitboard and a browser meet at the Share extension, which hands the app the one link the
  browser shares, as a Pitboard link. Pitboard reads nothing a browser keeps.
- The code and the release meet at a `v` tag, which `.github/workflows/release.yml` turns
  into a release. [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) has the procedure.

## The state file

`~/.pitboard/state.json` is Pitboard's index: which accounts it knows, and where each one's
login is parked. It carries a `schema` number.

The app and the command line inside it update together. A command line installed another
way updates by its own route. So on one machine, an older Pitboard can meet a file a newer
one wrote.

Reading forwards is `state::migrate`. Each schema bump adds an arm that rewrites the
document and falls through to the next. A file two versions behind comes forward in one
read.

Reading backwards is not possible. The older Pitboard refuses the file and says to update
it. A bump needs a test that loads a file the previous version wrote.

Schema 4 records each account's tool, and which account is signed in for each tool. A
schema 3 file is brought forward on its first read, with no keychain item or vault file
touched.

A file naming a tool this build does not know is reported as written by a newer Pitboard,
not as corrupt. The advice for a corrupt file is to delete it, and following that here would
orphan every parked login.

Claude Desktop added no schema bump. Its accounts are schema 4 entries whose tool is
`desktop` and whose detail is `Detail::Desktop`: the organisation's uuid when known, the
session fingerprint (the SHA-256, in hex, of the `sessionKey` cookie's ciphertext) and when
that session lapses. Its usage is kept under `desktop:<account uuid>`. A Pitboard older than
this support reads such a file as naming an unknown tool, `state_names_unknown_tool`.

What a Claude Desktop switch needs beyond the index is in `~/.pitboard/desktop/`, a
directory of mode 0700 whose files are 0600:

- `parks/pitboard-tree-<uuid>-<millis>/`: one parked login, its items, `config-keys.json`
  with the three account keys, and `manifest.json` naming the account, the fingerprint and
  the items.
- `journal.json`: present only while a Claude Desktop switch is unfinished. It names items
  and inodes, never values.
- `strays/<millis>/`: what Claude made while signed out, set aside and never deleted by
  Pitboard. One directory per switch or recovery, keeping each item's place; an item that
  would land on another gets a directory of its own.
- `awaiting.json`: the account parked by `pitboard use desktop --signed-out`, until the next
  enrolment.
- `live-usage.json`: whether live usage is on, and whether macOS let Pitboard read Claude's
  key. It never holds the key.
- `live-usage-ok.json`: when the last reading succeeded, and only that. It is a file of its
  own so a refresh, which writes it every time, never rewrites `live-usage.json` over what
  another process saved there.

## Tool registers

Every fact Pitboard relies on about a tool was read out of one build of that tool. Each tool
keeps its facts in a register, `crates/pitboard-core/src/provider/<tool>/assumptions.rs`,
dated with the build they were read from.

A fact names literals a build must contain (`probe`), or literals whose arrival would
disprove it (`absent`). Beside the facts, the register names those that only one system's
build can be read for (`read_on`). A fact about behaviour, such as the 30 second cache,
names no literals. `pitboard-conformance`
tells a macOS build from a Linux one by its header, and reports which facts can still be
read from it, which have moved, which name nothing to look for, and which it skipped as
read from the other system's builds.

The check is shallow on purpose. A literal being present does not prove the behaviour around
it is unchanged. A literal disappearing, or a ruled-out one appearing, does prove something
moved.

On 22 September 2026, the twelve facts the Claude Code register then held were checked
against six macOS builds. They could be read from 2.1.273 to 2.1.278, and the check went
red on 2.1.124. That build predates the credential write lock, two of the five
account-scoped keys and the keychain error classification. On 29 September the register was
read again from the macOS and Linux builds of 2.1.278, 2.1.281 and 2.1.284: every fact
holds on 2.1.281 and 2.1.284, and on 2.1.278 the three that describe the 2.1.281 change are
reported moved, as they should be.

`.github/workflows/conformance.yml` checks the newest build of each tool against its
register on Mondays and Thursdays, or a version given by hand: Claude Code's macOS and
Linux builds, and Codex's Linux build. Its most recent run says
which facts can still be read from the build it checked, and which have moved.

Adding a tool takes three things: a register read out of a named build, a module under
`provider/` implementing `Provider`, and a conformance job. Claude Desktop is the
exception to the last: its literals live in `app.asar`, not in a binary the checker reads,
so every entry has an empty probe and no conformance job runs. Its four entries not yet
measured are dated `UNVERIFIED` and name the experiment that will settle each one, as
[Claude Desktop under Measured facts](#claude-desktop) lists. `ProviderId`,
`ProviderId::ALL` and the matches in `provider::of` and `assumptions::of` name every tool.
The compiler and the tests then point at what an added tool has to fill in.

How to run the checker and add a fact is in
[Tool registers in CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#tool-registers).

## Account windows

The app gives each enrolled account a window on its tool's site: claude.ai for a Claude
Code account, and chatgpt.com for a Codex account. The site's own pages run in it, in
WebKit, with a store of website data that belongs to that account alone. A page shared from
a browser's Share menu reaches the app as a Pitboard link, and the person chooses which
account's window opens it.

The windows read the accounts from the app's last read. No window is ever given a Claude
Code or Codex login. The facts this rests on are under
[WebKit and SwiftUI](#webkit-and-swiftui) and
[claude.ai and chatgpt.com](#claudeai-and-chatgptcom).

### Where the code is

- `crates/pitboard-sites`: what a site is, and what a link from outside may be, in the
  [code map](#code-map). The app reaches it through `pitboard-ffi`'s `Site` and `SiteLink`
  records: its windows and menus ask `sites`, `sites_for` and `site_names`, and
  `LinkInbox.swift` reads each Pitboard link with `read_pitboard_link` and says a refusal
  with `link_refusal_reason`. Only the tests make a link with `site_link`. The Share
  extension reaches it through `pitboard-share-ffi`.
- `apps/macos/Sources/PitboardLinkTarget`: where a Pitboard link goes, which the app and the
  Share extension both link. `LinkTarget.swift` names the Info.plist key `PitboardURLScheme`
  that gives each build its scheme, and finds the app an extension is inside.
- `crates/pitboard-ffi/src/account_windows`: the windows' rules, in the
  [code map](#code-map). Which accounts have a window, the store each one's data is kept
  in, the menus' entries and the forget alert's text; where each navigation, new window,
  response and download of a page goes; what a window says above its page and before it
  removes what it keeps; what a page may use and close; whose words a dialog says; what a
  download is called and where it comes from; what becomes of a page whose content stops;
  and how big a sign-in window opens. The Swift below turns what WebKit says into what
  these read, and does what they decide.
- `apps/macos/Sources/PitboardApp/AccountWindows`: the windows.
  - `WindowAccount.swift` gives a window's store as the `UUID` WebKit names a store by and
    the scene keeps a window's value as.
  - `NavigationPolicy.swift` turns WebKit's URLs and a navigation's target frame into what
    `decide_navigation` reads. `WindowNote.swift` is what a window says above its page.
  - `Page.swift` owns one `WKWebView` and publishes its title, address, progress and
    history, in the shape of SwiftUI's `WebPage`. `PageDelegate.swift` answers WebKit's
    navigation and UI delegates for a page by asking the core's rules.
  - `WebSession.swift` is one open window: its account, policy, page, note and sign-in
    window. `PopupWindow.swift` is that sign-in window, an AppKit window, since WebKit needs
    its web view back before a SwiftUI scene could open.
  - `Downloads.swift` keeps every window's downloads past the window, gives each the name
    `download_destination` chooses, and asks before one the site's own page did not start.
    `PageDialogs.swift` shows a page's alerts, questions and file choosers as sheets, and
    asks that download question.
  - `WebViewHost.swift` places a page's web view in SwiftUI, with the system find bar above
    it. `AccountWindowView.swift` is the window, and `AccountWindowCommands.swift` its scene
    and its items in the **File**, **Edit**, **View** and **Go** menus.
  - `AccountWindows.swift` owns the feature: the open sessions, links waiting for a window
    still opening, windows asked for from the Dock, each window's last page, the store
    janitor and the downloads. `AppModel.afterRead` tells it of each read that succeeded.
  - `StoreJanitor.swift` records, makes, wipes and deletes stores. `WebEnvironment.swift` is
    the world a launch's windows run in: the sites and WebKit's stores, or a fixture's
    stand-ins.
  - `LinkInbox.swift` holds the link the Share extension handed over, and
    `AccountPicker.swift` is the **Open Link** window that asks which account opens it.
- `apps/macos/Sources/PitboardApp/System/WebsiteData.swift`: WebKit's persistent stores, behind
  the `WebsiteDataStores` protocol. Beside them, two records kept in the app's preferences
  under each Pitboard directory's path: `StoreRecord`, the stores the directory made, under
  `webStores`, and `PageRecord`, the page each account's window was last on, under
  `windowPages`, by store.
- `apps/macos/Sources/PitboardApp/App`: `AppDelegate.swift` owns the app's models and answers
  what only a delegate can: the Dock icon's menu, a click on the Dock icon, and quitting
  while a download runs. `AppPresence.swift` gives the app a Dock icon and its menus while
  any of its windows is open. `RefreshCommand.swift` is **View** > **Refresh**, whose
  title and action the window in front gives. `PitboardScenes.swift` adds the account
  windows' scene and the **Open Link** window, the one scene that takes a Pitboard link.
- `apps/macos/Sources/PitboardApp/Fixture/FixtureWeb.swift`: a fixture's stand-in pages for each
  site and sign-in host, on `pitboard-fixture://`, with stores in memory and links to
  anywhere else recorded and opened nowhere.
- `apps/macos/ShareExtension`: the `PitboardShare` target. It checks the shared page with
  `share_link`, which writes the Pitboard link too, then opens that link with the app it is
  inside, not whichever copy Launch Services would pick. The flow of an app extension stays
  Swift, and `PitboardLinkTarget` finds the app it is inside and the scheme its Info.plist
  names.

### What must stay true

- One store per account, derived from the account. A window's store is a version 5 UUID of
  `<store name>:<account id>` in a fixed namespace, which `store_id` writes in lower case.
  It is also the window's value, so there is one window per account, and a rename keeps its
  sign-in. The namespace and the store names, `claude` and `codex`, never change: a change
  would leave every window without its data, and the next sweep would delete that data.
  Golden tests in `stores.rs` pin them, and that the account id is lowered a character at
  a time, as Swift's `lowercased()` lowered it for every store released, where
  `str::to_lowercase` lowers a sigma that ends a word otherwise. A store id an app hands
  back is compared without regard to case, since Foundation writes a UUID in upper case.
- A store is recorded before WebKit makes it, in the app's preferences, under the path of
  the Pitboard directory the app reads. A store WebKit made and nobody recorded would never
  be deleted.
- A store is deleted only when this Pitboard directory recorded it, and a read that
  succeeded no longer derives it from any enrolled account. Every read that succeeds lists
  every enrolled account, from `state.json`, so that is a forgotten account, forgotten in
  the app or with `pitboard forget`. Nothing is deleted before the first read that
  succeeds, or after one that failed.
- A store that another Pitboard directory recorded too is never deleted while that
  directory exists. The same account enrolled in both derives the same store, so deleting
  it would sign the other directory's window out. Forgetting the account in one removes
  only that directory's record.
- A store nobody recorded is left alone. WebKit keeps every store of one bundle under the
  person's own Library, whatever `HOME` says, so it can belong to a copy run with another
  home. A store something still holds is left recorded, and tried again at the next read.
- Nothing from outside opens a window by itself. A Pitboard link only shows the **Open
  Link** window, and only a person's choice there opens a window, on the link's own site.
  The app checks the link as strictly as the extension did, since anything on the Mac can
  open one. A site's sign-in link is refused, since it would sign the window in as whoever
  it belongs to.
- A window's page goes only to its site, the site's sign-in hosts and blank pages. Google's
  sign-in is refused, other web pages go to the default browser, an email address goes to
  the email app when clicked, and nothing else leaves. What the page embeds in its frames,
  such as an artifact, is the page's own choice, except a local file.
- A new window is decided only in `createWebViewWith`, where WebKit asks for the page to
  put in it. The navigation's own decision lets through a link that asks for one: refused
  there, WebKit would never ask for the window, and a sign-in link would open nothing.
- Only the site's own main page, or a sign-in page as the window's main page, opens a
  sign-in window. A frame, such as an artifact, gets none: it could fill the window with a
  page of its own, which nothing on the window's title would tell apart.
- A sign-in window is made from the configuration WebKit hands `createWebViewWith`, a copy
  of its opener's, so it shares the account's store and keeps `window.opener`. Its page
  loads only the site and its sign-in hosts, and goes blank only when the page itself asks,
  never its opener. It saves nothing and opens no window.
- Only a site's own pages are kept as a window's last page. **Remove Website Data** takes
  it away, and so does a read that succeeded and no longer lists the account.
- Hands off the session. Pitboard makes a store, wipes one when asked and deletes one when
  its account is forgotten. It never reads, copies or changes what a site keeps there,
  adds no script or message handler to a page and sets no user agent of its own. No web
  session is made from a Claude Code or Codex login.
- The Pitboard link's format is a contract between the Share extension and the app, pinned
  by a golden test. A release claims `pitboard://` and a debug build `pitboard-debug://`,
  so a debug build never answers a link meant for an installed copy. A release build from
  `build-app.sh` claims `pitboard://` like the installed copy, until it is unregistered.
  `build-app.sh` fails a bundle whose app or extension names another scheme.
- The Share extension stays sandboxed, with no other entitlement, and links only
  `PitboardShareBindings` and `PitboardLinkTarget`. `build-app.sh` signs it with its
  entitlements before the app, and fails when its signature is not sandboxed. The release
  workflow checks the installed copy again.
- The extension checks a link by the same Rust as the app, `pitboard-sites`, but through
  `pitboard-share-ffi`, and never links the core: the core's bindings check every export's
  checksum when they load, so linking them brings all of it in. Two Rust static libraries
  never meet in one binary, since each carries its own copy of Rust's standard library.
  `build-app.sh` fails when the extension's binary has a `uniffi_pitboard_ffi_` symbol or
  none of `uniffi_pitboard_share_ffi_`, or the app's has a `uniffi_pitboard_share_ffi_`
  symbol or none of `uniffi_pitboard_ffi_`. No test target of the Swift package links
  `PitboardShareBindings`, since SwiftPM may link every test target into one bundle.
- `pitboard-sites` stays a leaf: no I/O, nothing of the core and no UniFFI, and `url` for
  IDNA alone. Each binding crate declares its own types over it, since the C# generator
  cannot use another crate's.

## Measured facts

These decide the design. Each gives the build it was read from, or the date it was measured
or written down. The conformance run reads only the facts in a tool's register, and only
by their literals.

### macOS

Measured on macOS 26 and written down on 22 September 2026. Before changing code that
depends on the `security -i` limit or the Security framework's cost, measure them again on
a scratch item.

- `security -i` reads at most 4097 bytes of command from standard input, with no line
  continuation. Its interactive `-w` prompt takes 128 bytes.
- A keychain item written in process, through the Security framework, stays slow to read.
  Every later read of it by `security` takes about a second instead of 0.01 seconds. On a
  scratch item, reads went from 0.01 seconds to 20.55, then settled around 0.8.
- Claude Code reads its login on every cache miss, so writing its item through the framework
  would slow Claude Code for good. Pitboard writes a large login on the argument line
  instead, where `ps` can see it for the length of one call.
- Undoing the framework's change needs `security set-key-partition-list`, which asks for the
  keychain password.
- APFS keeps a directory's mtime in nanoseconds, but not exactly: setting one and reading it
  straight back gives a value 18 to 60 nanoseconds away. A lock that remembered the value it
  asked for would abandon every switch, so `lock.rs` keeps the value read back.
- Pitboard lists its parked items with `security dump-keychain` without `-d`. It never
  prompts, and emits attributes only, no secret of any item. It exits 0 in 0.06 seconds
  against a keychain of 362 items.
- Reads after a `dump-keychain` take the usual 0.016 seconds, so listing has none of the
  access-list cost of an in-process read. Each service name is on a line of the form
  `"svce"<blob>="<name>"`.

### Claude Code

Read against Claude Code 2.1.284's own storage layer, macOS and Linux builds alike, on 29
September 2026, unless a fact gives its own date. The conformance runs of 24 and 28
September reported three facts moved on 2.1.281 and 2.1.283. All three were false: they
read the Linux build, which has no keychain code, and a `libsecret` that belongs to the Bun
runtime Claude Code ships in. The one real change, in 2.1.281, is how a locked keychain is
treated, and only the macOS build shows it. The run reads both builds since.

- A running session serves its login from a 30 second cache, so it picks up a switch within
  about 33 seconds.
- Every write of the login takes proper-lockfile's directory lock at
  `<storage dir>/.storage-write`: stale after 15000 ms, ten retries, 100 ms to 1000 ms of
  backoff. `lock.rs` carries the same numbers.
- Every write under that lock drops the read cache, reads the login again inside the lock,
  and abandons the write when that read fails. A stale account cannot be written back. From
  2.1.281, a locked keychain counts as a failed read here once the process has seen its
  item; before, it read as empty.
- Claude Code treats its own lock going missing as a warning and keeps writing. Pitboard
  cannot expect the other side to stop.
- A write can be marked as already locked without the lock being taken. `/logout` does this
  after retrying for 7.5 seconds, and deletes the login with no lock held.
- The keychain write is `security -i` while the command is at most 4032 bytes. Past that it
  is `add-generic-password -U -a <account> -s <service> -X <hex>`, on the argument line. It
  never refuses or splits a login, and each call has a 2 second timeout.
- A failed write is transient, and does not move the login to the plaintext file, when it
  timed out or, from 2.1.281, when it exited 36 after the process had seen its item. Any
  other failure moves the login to the file.
- The login goes hex-encoded, two characters a byte, so standard input carries about 2 KB of
  it. A larger login is on Claude Code's own argument line at every token refresh. Pitboard
  keeps its `security -i` command within the same 4032 bytes, the limit its messages give.
- The keychain read is `find-generic-password -a <account> -w -s <service>`. Exit 0 with
  output is the login; exit 0 with nothing, 44, or output that is not JSON is absent. Exit
  36, a locked keychain, is absent to an ordinary read, a failed read to a write once the
  process has seen its item (from 2.1.281), and a failed read outright only when a caller
  asks. Pitboard reads 36 as unreadable on purpose, the strict end of that.
  `security show-keychain-info` exiting 36 only adds an unlock hint.
- On macOS the live chain is the keychain, with the plaintext file `.credentials.json`
  behind it. The successor backend, behind the `tengu_hover_rest` flag, replaces only the
  fallback half, and only for a caller that hands one in. An ordinary `claude` still reads
  the keychain first.
- Claude Code demotes to the plaintext file when a keychain write fails for good, and
  deletes the keychain item when it does. A locked keychain after the item was seen is not
  failing for good, from 2.1.281.
- The supervisor daemon records itself in `<config dir>/daemon.lock`, with its pid and the
  Claude Code version that started it. It leaves the file behind when it stops.
- Claude Code's storage backends are `keychain`, `plaintext` and `windows-credman`, the
  last behind the `tengu_windows_credman` flag. Its code has no `libsecret`,
  `org.freedesktop.secrets`, `gnome-keyring` or `SecretService`. The Linux binary does
  contain `libsecret`, in the Bun runtime it ships in, behind `Bun.secrets`, which Claude
  Code's code never calls.
- `secret-tool` and `kwallet-query` do appear in the bundle, in the credential helpers its
  Bash sandbox keeps out of a shell. So neither name is used to look for a keyring backend.
- On Linux, Claude Code has no keychain backend at all: the plaintext file holds the login.
  Claude Code writes it, then sets its mode to 0600, and Pitboard's Linux host matches
  that.
- The register holds that absence as `no_keyring_off_macos`, and the conformance run looks
  for `Bun.secrets` and each keyring name in every Linux build. A fact that rests on
  something not existing is wrong the moment it does.
- A Claude Code parked login holds the account's slice of Claude Code's credential
  document. On one real account, measured on 22 September 2026, the slice was 524 bytes
  against 506 for the OAuth block alone. An account holding a device token has not been
  measured.
- Claude Code's config file can be a day behind the login it describes, so Pitboard asks
  Anthropic whose a login is. This was written down on 21 September 2026, with no build
  named.
- On 22 September 2026, the machine measured sat within 0.75 seconds of the `Date` header
  of api.anthropic.com across eight requests. `Date` has a granularity of one second.
- That spread is inside the noise, so Pitboard keeps no estimate of clock skew. A renewal's
  expiries are counted from the `Date` of the answer that carried them.
- Read from 2.1.289 on 5 October 2026: before it opens the browser, `claude auth login`
  writes an `https` address and `Paste code here if prompted > ` to stdout, and from then
  on reads a pasted code. So the app offers the code field with the address. The address
  is the manual one, whose page shows the code; the browser it opens goes to another,
  which comes back to the loopback. Piped, the address is bare unless `FORCE_HYPERLINK` is
  set or the environment names a terminal that takes hyperlinks, such as `TERM_PROGRAM` set
  to iTerm.app or `WT_SESSION` set. Then it is an OSC 8 hyperlink ended by BEL, with the
  address again as its text. The sign-in runs with the app's whole environment, so
  `provider/printed.rs` reads what it printed as a terminal does, and the address offered
  is where the hyperlink goes.
- Read on 5 October 2026 from the macOS builds of 2.1.283 and 2.1.289 and the Linux build of
  2.1.289: the native installer puts its launcher at `~/.local/bin/claude`, and says so
  when that directory is not on `PATH`. A global npm install puts `claude` in npm's global
  `bin`, which is Homebrew's `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin` where Homebrew
  installed Node, and `/usr/local/bin` where nodejs.org's installer did; the build lists
  both among npm's places. Claude Code tells a global npm install by
  `/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/` in the path the running program resolves to, and the
  Homebrew cask's by a path through a Homebrew `Caskroom`. So an app with no shell's `PATH`
  looks in `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`, after the login
  shell's.

### Codex

Read against codex-cli 0.154.0: the binary, its public source at tag `rust-v0.154.0`, and a
real `auth.json` that build wrote. The register is `provider/codex/assumptions.rs`.

- The login is `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, by default `~/.codex/auth.json`, at mode 0600.
- `file` is the packaged default store on every platform, and the only one Pitboard
  supports. `keyring`, `auto` and `ephemeral` are the others.
- `keyring` and `auto` keep the login in a keychain item, `Codex Auth`, that Codex makes
  through the Security framework. With either of those, the `secret_auth_storage` feature
  keeps it in `secrets/codex_auth.age` instead, under a keychain key.
- Those items trust only `codex`. A read by another program brings up a permission prompt,
  and choosing **Always Allow** would change Codex's item. So Pitboard refuses `keyring`
  and `auto`, with or without that feature.
- The login document holds `auth_mode`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `last_refresh`, and `tokens` with
  `id_token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token` and `account_id`. `OPENAI_API_KEY` can hold an
  API key Codex obtained at sign-in.
- `codex login` and `codex logout` both POST the stored refresh token to
  `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/revoke` before clearing it. This is why parking a Codex
  login moves it (`ParkSemantics::MoveOnly`).
- A running Codex holds its login in memory for the life of the process and watches no file.
  It refuses a reload whose account id has changed (`Adoption::RestartRequired`), so it
  never picks up a switch.
- A Codex refresh already under way when the file changes writes its own account's tokens
  under whatever account id it finds there.
- Codex writes `auth.json` with no lock of any kind, so there is none for Pitboard to share.
- Measured on 2026-10-01 from the process list of a Mac running each of them:
  - OpenAI's ChatGPT app for macOS 26.928.31416, bundle id `com.openai.codex`, runs a codex
    0.159.2 of its own: two processes of
    `ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex-cli/CodexCLI.app/Contents/MacOS/codex`, children
    of the app. That closing its windows leaves it running, and quitting it stops them, is
    read from the app's code and not yet watched.
  - Codex's background app server runs from
    `$CODEX_HOME/packages/app-server-daemon/releases/<version>/bin/codex`, a child of
    launchd, and 0.159.3 has `codex app-server daemon restart`.
  - On macOS, `ps` gives what a process was started as. A `codex` started from a shell by
    its bare name lists as `codex`; one started by its path lists the path. Pitboard tells
    the kinds apart by the directories in that path, and a bare name is a `codex` session.
  - No editor with the Codex extension was running there. Its place, a folder named
    `openai.chatgpt-<version>`, is the extension's packaged layout, not measured.
- The ID token names the account: `email`, and under `https://api.openai.com/auth`,
  `chatgpt_account_id` and `chatgpt_user_id`. A Team or Business workspace shares one
  `chatgpt_account_id`, and `chatgpt_user_id` is the person.
- Pitboard identifies a Codex account by that pair, with no network call.
- Renewal is `POST https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token` with a JSON body
  `{client_id, grant_type, refresh_token}` and client id `app_EMoamEEZ73f0CkXaXp7hrann`.
  Each token in the answer is written only if present.
- `last_refresh` must be in the login, as an RFC 3339 string, or Codex reads the login as
  having no token data.
- A spent or revoked refresh token answers 400 `invalid_grant`, or one of the older
  `refresh_token_expired`, `refresh_token_reused` and `refresh_token_invalidated`, or 401.
  Any other 400 is not a dead login.
- Usage is `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with `Authorization: Bearer`
  and `ChatGPT-Account-ID`, and spends no quota.
- The usage answer's shape was read from a live answer. A parser written from the source
  looked for the windows in the wrong place, and returned nothing while the request
  succeeded.
- `CODEX_HOME` moves everything Codex keeps, and an empty one means unset. Pitboard's own
  sign-in, the one `enroll --sign-in` runs, sets it to a directory that exists, and runs
  `codex login` from inside it.
- The sign-in starts inside that directory because Codex also reads `.codex/config.toml`
  from a trusted project it starts in. That file could name a keychain store.
- `codex login` revokes the login stored in its home before signing in. It opens the
  browser itself and reads nothing from standard input.
- Read from 0.160.0 on 5 October 2026: `codex login` prints to stderr its loopback address,
  `http://localhost:<port>`, and then, bare on a line of its own, the `https` address on
  auth.openai.com to open. So the first `https` address it prints is the one to open.
- Codex's standalone installer, `scripts/install/install.sh` at tag `rust-v0.159.2`, links
  `~/.local/bin/codex`, or `$CODEX_INSTALL_DIR/codex`, to
  `$CODEX_HOME/packages/standalone/current/bin/codex`; a standalone install of 0.159.2 on a
  Mac had left that link, read on 5 October 2026. Its macOS and Linux binaries name
  `npm install -g @openai/codex` and `brew upgrade --cask codex` as the other ways it is
  kept up to date. 0.154.0 names those too, but not the standalone package layout.

### WebKit and SwiftUI

Measured on macOS 27.0 on 4 October 2026, with probe apps built by Xcode 27.1 against the
macOS 27 SDK, unless a fact gives its own date. Several were checked again with the app's
own code driving WebKit on a fixture's stand-in pages. Before changing code that depends on
one, measure it again.

- SwiftUI's `WebPage` cannot host an account window. `window.open` returns null for every
  trigger and no app callback fires, so a sign-in that opens a window never starts. A
  `target=_blank` link loads nothing unless the app loads it itself, which loses the
  opener. A download never reaches the app or the disk, and `WebPage` has no page zoom or
  print. So `Page` keeps a `WKWebView`, in `WebPage`'s shape.
- On a `WKWebView`, a `target=_blank` link reaches `decidePolicyFor` first, with no target
  frame. Cancelled there, it never reaches `createWebViewWith`; allowed, it does, with the
  same action. `window.open` goes straight to `createWebViewWith`.
- `window.open('')` reaches `createWebViewWith` with an empty address. The page in the new
  window then navigates, through its own `decidePolicyFor`. `webViewDidClose` fires on
  `window.close()`. A `target=_blank` link without `rel=opener` gives the new page no
  opener.
- WebKit quarantines a downloaded file itself, and makes the suggested name safe:
  `../../evil:name.txt` becomes `_.._evil_name.txt`. A response turned into a download also
  fails its navigation with code 102 in `WebKitErrorDomain`, which the window does not show.
  `WKDownload.originatingFrame` is macOS 15.2 and later.
- A response from an app's own scheme handler loses its headers and cannot become a
  download, so a fixture's downloads are `data:` and `blob:` links.
- `allDataStoreIdentifiers` and `remove(forIdentifier:)` each end in a segmentation fault in
  `WTF::RunLoop::dispatch` when they are a process's first WebKit call. Making any store
  first prevents it. So `WebKitDataStores` makes a non-persistent store before its first
  deletion, not at launch, and a person who never opens a window never starts WebKit.
- `remove(forIdentifier:)` reports a store in use for 20 to 60 ms after its last web view
  and store object are released, then succeeds. It reports it in use for as long as a
  `WKWebsiteDataStore` object for it is held. The janitor's retries, from 50 ms doubling to
  1600 ms, cover the first case, and the next read covers the second.
- `removeData(ofTypes:modifiedSince:)` with every type since `.distantPast`, on a store a
  page is using, clears every cookie, `HttpOnly` ones included, local and session storage,
  and IndexedDB. **Remove Website Data** rests on it to sign a window out while it stays
  open.
- A `WKWebView` answers neither `performFindPanelAction:` nor `performTextFinderAction:`.
  An `NSTextFinder` with the web view as its client and `WebContainer` as its bar's
  container shows the system find bar and steps through the matches.
- With incremental searching on, **Find Next** left the page's selection where it was, so
  it is off and a search runs on Return. A finder whose bar is already in the view, hidden,
  never shows it, so `WebContainer` adds the bar only while it shows.
  `TextEditingCommands()` adds the **Edit** > **Find** items, which send
  `performFindPanelAction:` with `NSTextFinder.Action` tags.
- Setting `pageZoom` leaves a pinch's `magnification` as it was, so **Actual Size** resets
  both.
- SwiftUI hands a URL to the `Window` scene that has `.handlesExternalEvents(matching:)`,
  through its `onOpenURL`, whether the app was running or not. It opens that window when
  none is open, reuses one that is, and opens no other window. With no scene claiming the
  URL, it went to the first window scene, the Pitboard window's, and opened that window.
- With an app delegate's `application(_:open:)` as well, the claiming scene's `onOpenURL`
  gets the URL and the delegate is then called with an empty list. With no scene claiming
  it, only the delegate gets it, and no window opens. So the **Open Link** window alone
  takes Pitboard links, and `AppDelegate` has no `application(_:open:)`.
- Those URLs were sent with `open -a` from a terminal. A cold launch that way left the app
  inactive, behind the terminal, so the **Open Link** window brings Pitboard forward when a
  link arrives. `AppPresence.comeForward` records that a link from the Share extension at a
  launch left Pitboard in the background too. A link opened from a browser was not measured.
- In CI, on macOS 26.6.2, the running app's **Open Link** window took each link too.
  `XCUIApplication.open(_:)` sent them, and it launched a second copy of the app rather
  than handing the link to the one running: the picker opened in one copy and the Pitboard
  window in the one the test watched. The copy left running kept its menu bar item, and
  with a few of those a later test's own item sat under the menus, out of reach. So the
  UI tests share a link through `XCUIDevice.shared.system.open(_:)`, which opens it with
  Launch Services, as the Share extension does, and so reaches the copy running.
- A window's root view gets `onAppear` when its window opens and `onDisappear` when it
  closes, not when it is minimised or becomes a background tab. `AppPresence` counts open
  windows by them. `openWindow(id:value:)` with the value of an open window brings that
  window back and opens no other.
- `SceneStorage`'s documentation in the macOS 27 SDK says its data is destroyed when a
  window is closed on macOS. So an account window's last page is kept in the app's
  preferences, by the window's store, and comes back in a window opened from a menu as well
  as in one macOS restores. This was read, not measured.
- The account picker's root view gets `onDisappear` before the account window it opened
  gets `onAppear`. Going back to `.accessory` in between gives the app's activation away, so
  the account window opens behind the browser; `AppPresence` waits a moment before going
  back to the menu bar.
- SwiftUI puts an item that opens each `Window` scene in the **Window** menu, unless
  `.commandsRemoved()` is applied, and does not list that scene's window there. A
  `WindowGroup`'s windows are listed while they are open.
- After `setActivationPolicy(.regular)` on an app that is already active,
  `NSWorkspace.menuBarOwningApplication` goes on naming the app before it, but the menu bar
  shows the app's own menus, seen in a screen capture on 4 October 2026 with a probe that
  has a main menu of its own. The reported owner is not what the person sees. An app made
  regular while inactive and then opened by Launch Services is reported as the owner as
  well. `NSApp.deactivate()` from an active app left it active.
- Measured on 4 October 2026 with a probe app driven by `open -g`: `NSApp.activate()` from
  an app in the background, with no click in it, is refused. Launch Services opening the
  app, `NSWorkspace.openApplication` with `activates` set, brings it forward. So
  `AppPresence.comeForward` asks Launch Services to open Pitboard when a shared link arrives
  while Pitboard is in the background.
- The macOS 27 SDK has no SwiftUI API for a Dock menu. `applicationDockMenu(_:)` on the app
  delegate is the API.
- Measured on 29 September 2026: WebKit keeps the persistent stores of an app that is not
  sandboxed under `~/Library/WebKit/<bundle id>/WebsiteDataStore/<identifier>`, cookies
  included, as ordinary files. It roots them at the Library folder Foundation gives the
  app, and Foundation does not read `HOME`. With `HOME` pointed at a scratch directory,
  `NSHomeDirectory()`, `.libraryDirectory` and `homeDirectoryForCurrentUser` all still gave
  the real home. The core reads `HOME` and `PITBOARD_HOME`, so the record of stores is kept
  per Pitboard directory.

### Foundation's URLs

Measured on macOS 27.0 on 5 October 2026, by giving the Swift `SiteLink` and `Handoff` of
0.7.0, and `URLComponents(string:)`, the same text as `pitboard-sites`. `pitboard-sites`
reads a link as Foundation does, so a link from outside means what it meant to the macOS
app.

- `URLComponents(string:)` splits a link by RFC 3986. A path, query or fragment holding a
  character RFC 3986 does not allow there is kept with every such character
  percent-encoded, a `%` among them, so an escape already in it is encoded too: `/%41 x` is
  kept as `/%2541%20x`. One holding none is kept as written, escapes and all. A second `#`
  is `%23` in the fragment.
- A host is never encoded: one with a character RFC 3986 does not allow, or a `%` that
  starts no escape, makes no link. A host in plain ASCII is percent-decoded and kept in its
  case, `claude.ai%00` included. One that is not, or that has an `xn--` label, goes through
  ICU's IDNA: `ｃｌａｕｄｅ.ai` is `claude.ai`, `xn--bcher-kva.de` reads back as `bücher.de`,
  and a joiner in a label makes no link. Anything between brackets is an IP literal.
- `user` and `password` are nil where their bytes are not UTF-8, `port` is nil where an
  `Int` cannot hold the number, and `path` is empty where its bytes are not UTF-8. So the
  Swift `SiteLink` opened `https://%FF@claude.ai/` and `https://claude.ai:99999999999999999999/`
  without what it dropped, took `claude.ai/magic-link/%FF` for no sign-in link, and opened
  `claude.ai/x/../%FF` without seeing its dot segment. The Swift `Handoff` read
  `pitboard://open/%FF?url=claude.ai` as `pitboard://open?url=claude.ai`. `pitboard-sites`
  refuses each.
- Swift compares strings by grapheme cluster, so a combining mark or a joiner right after a
  `/` makes one character with it. The Swift `SiteLink` took `claude.ai/magic-link/%CC%81`
  for no sign-in link, and `chat.com/` followed by a combining mark for no link at all. It
  counted a link's length in clusters too, and opened one of 4106 clusters and 8194
  scalars. `pitboard-sites` compares the text, and counts a link's length in Unicode
  scalars.
- `CharacterSet.whitespacesAndNewlines`, which trims a link, is Unicode's `White_Space` and
  U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE, checked over every scalar.
- The WHATWG URL standard, which the `url` crate and WebKit follow, reads a link otherwise.
  It resolves dot segments, takes `\` for `/` in an `https` link, drops a default port such
  as `:443`, finds a host in `https:claude.ai`, strips a tab or a newline and leaves a second
  `#` as it is. It reads a host whose last label is a number as an IPv4 address, and decodes
  a host's escapes before IDNA. So `pitboard-sites` asks `url` for IDNA alone, with a label
  after the host so that no host is read as an address.
- 450,000 generated links and Pitboard links, ASCII and not, had the same answer from both
  apart from: Pitboard links that `URL(string:)` refuses, which never reach the macOS app,
  though the Windows app, reading a Pitboard link from its command line as text, can be
  given one; the things above that `pitboard-sites` refuses; grapheme clusters; and hosts
  that are not ASCII, where ICU's and WHATWG's IDNA differ over empty labels, escapes and
  what a label may hold. Each such host was refused by both, though one named it otherwise,
  apart from `ｃ%EF%BD%8Caude.ai`: `pitboard-sites` decodes its escapes before IDNA, as the
  WHATWG standard does, and takes it for `claude.ai`, where the Swift `SiteLink` said it was
  on `cｌaude.ai`.
- `URL(string:)` reads a host otherwise than `URLComponents`, and an account window's rules
  compared the `URL` WebKit handed them, so `pitboard-sites`' `WebAddress` reads one as
  `URL.host` does, measured on 5 October 2026. A host in ASCII is percent-decoded and kept
  in its case, `xn--bcher-kva.de` and `XN--BCHER-KVA.de` as written, and so is one with an
  `xn--` label IDNA refuses, `xn--claude-.ai`, for which `URLComponents.host` is nil. A
  host that is not ASCII is given in IDNA's ASCII form, `аpple.com` with a Cyrillic а as
  `xn--pple-43d.com`, and one IDNA refuses makes no `URL`. An IP literal is given without
  its brackets. `https:///x`, `https:claude.ai/x`, `blob:` and `data:` links name no host.
  `port` is `0` for `:0`, and nil for `claude.ai:`; `user` is empty, not nil, for
  `https://@claude.ai/`. `WebAddress` reads two things otherwise: it keeps a port no `Int`
  holds, and names no host in `//claude.ai/x`, where `URL` reads `claude.ai` on no scheme.
- `NSString` splits a file name into a base and an extension at its last `.`, and finds no
  extension where it would be empty or hold a space, or where the base would be empty, `.`
  or `..`: `....a` has the extension `a`, `...a` none. `lastPathComponent` drops the
  slashes at the end, and is `/` for slashes alone. Measured the same day on 98 names, with
  the Swift `DownloadCenter` naming 52 of them as a download, free and with its own name
  taken.
- A file `URL`'s `path` is decomposed: `URL(fileURLWithPath:)` and `appendingPathComponent`
  give `Báo cáo.pdf` as `Ba\u{301}o ca\u{301}o.pdf`. So the Swift `DownloadCenter`, which
  compared `URL`s, numbered a download whose name a running one had in either form, though
  not `\u{F900}.pdf` against `\u{8C48}.pdf`, its canonical decomposition, nor two names
  that differ only in case. APFS, on this Mac's volume that is not case-sensitive, takes
  each pair for one file: one made under either name is found under the other. Measured the
  same day. `download_destination` compares the names it reserved decomposed, so it numbers
  the U+F900 pair too, and takes two that differ only in case for two, as the Swift did.
- `CharacterSet.whitespaces`, which trims a `Content-Disposition`, is a tab, Unicode's
  `Zs` and U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE, checked over every scalar. It holds no newline.

### claude.ai and chatgpt.com

Read and measured on 29 September 2026. Nobody has watched a sign-in complete in a window.
That needs a person, in a debug build with a scratch home.

- `chat.openai.com` answers 308, `www.chatgpt.com` 301 and `chat.com` 307, each to the same
  path and query on `chatgpt.com`, measured with `curl`. So `Site.chatGPT` takes them as
  aliases.
- OpenAI's help centre, article 7426629, lists signing in to ChatGPT with a password or with
  Google, Microsoft or Apple, and names `auth.openai.com` among the hosts its sign-in needs.
- Third-party code that drives the sign-in, and the buttons' connection names, put the
  Microsoft and Apple sign-ins on `login.live.com`, `login.microsoftonline.com` and
  `appleid.apple.com`. The same reading has the sign-in come back through
  `chatgpt.com/api/auth`. How chatgpt.com's Microsoft and Apple buttons open their sign-in,
  in a new window, by a link or by a redirect, is not known.
- Not measured: whether email sign-in completes in a window, whether a window's session
  survives a restart, and whether Cloudflare's challenges pass WebKit's own user agent.
- The Share menu lists app extensions in Safari's toolbar and **File** menu, and in
  **File** > **Share** in Chrome and in Firefox from 92. That was read from the browsers'
  source and bug trackers, and no browser was run. Which other browsers list the extension
  is not known.

### Claude Desktop

Read from Claude Desktop 2.19675.0 on one Mac on 3 October 2026, read only: the bundle, the
data folder's listing and sizes, the cookie database read without decrypting anything, the
process list, the keychain item's attributes, and the exit code of one read of the key from
a shell with no screen. The register is
`provider/desktop/assumptions.rs`. No literal of the app can be probed for, so no
conformance job reads it.

- The app is `/Applications/Claude.app`, version 2.19675.0 in both `CFBundleShortVersionString`
  and `CFBundleVersion`, bundle id `com.anthropic.claudefordesktop`, signed by team
  `Q6L2SF6YDW`. Its Info.plist carries `ElectronAsarIntegrity`, and its code is in
  `app.asar` and `app.asar.unpacked`.
- The main process is `Contents/MacOS/Claude`. Its helpers run from inside the bundle with
  `--user-data-dir=~/Library/Application Support/Claude`. `Contents/Helpers/chrome-native-host`
  runs apart from the app.
- The data folder, `~/Library/Application Support/Claude`, held 1.3 GB. The account's part
  of it is about 6 MB: `Cookies` (32 KB), `config.json` (10 KB), `Local Storage` (2.3 MB,
  origins `https://claude.ai` and `https://a.claude.ai`), `IndexedDB` (3.2 MB) and
  `Session Storage` (108 KB), with `WebStorage` (44 KB) and `File System` (40 KB), which
  move with it (E2).
- The rest is the machine's: `Cache` (685 MB), `Code Cache` (222 MB), `claude-code/`
  (431 MB), the GPU caches, `Shared Dictionary`, `Partitions`, `Local State` with no
  `os_crypt` key, `Preferences` and `claude_desktop_config.json`.
- Some of the folder is already kept per account by the app itself:
  `claude-code-sessions/<account>/<organisation>`, `local-agent-mode-sessions/`,
  `spaces-present/`, `ant-device-registry.json` and `cowork-enabled-cli-ops.json`. Three
  accounts had signed in on that Mac.
- No `Claude-3p` folder and no saved application state were there. The app's preferences
  plist held only AppKit keys. `Caches`, `HTTPStorages` and `Logs` hold more of the app's
  files outside the data folder.
- `Cookies` is SQLite in `journal_mode=delete`, with `meta.version` 24 and
  `last_compatible` 24. It held 20 cookies, all for claude.ai, each with an empty `value`
  and an `encrypted_value` starting `v10`.
- `sessionKey` and `sessionKeyV3` were 179 bytes each and expired on 30 October 2026, about
  four weeks out. Their ciphertexts had the same SHA-256. `sessionKeyLC`, `sessionKeyV3LC`,
  `routingHint`, `lastActiveOrg`, `__Host-ant_trusted_device` and `anthropic-device-id`
  were there too.
- While the app ran, `Cookies-journal` was 0 bytes with the same mtime as `Cookies`, and
  there was no `Cookies-wal`.
- `config.json` holds `oauth:tokenCache` and `oauth:tokenCacheV2`, base64 of values
  starting `v10`, and `lastKnownAccountUuid`, a 36-character uuid equal to the
  `ownerAccountId` in `cowork-enabled-cli-ops.json`.
- The keychain item `Claude Safe Storage` is a generic password with account `Claude Key`
  in the login keychain, its `cdat` equal to its `mdat`. Its attributes were read without
  its password.
- `security find-generic-password -w` on that item, run from a background shell of a
  Claude Code session with no screen, exited 36. It was not run over ssh.
- `plan-usage-history.json` is `{version: 2, samples: [{t, org, u: {fh, sd}}]}`. It held 87
  samples for one organisation.
- The home folder and the data folder were on one volume (`stat -f %d`).

Measured on 4 October 2026 on Claude Desktop 2.19675.0, `Cookies` meta version 24, with two
real claude.ai accounts and the data folder backed up first (31,674 entries). Only
fingerprints (12-character SHA-256 prefixes), inodes, exit codes and times were recorded.
Each experiment dates its register entry with the version:

- Log out in the app revokes the session at claude.ai (E1). A byte copy of the listed items
  and config keys, taken before Log out and put back after, was refused: within 5 seconds of
  launch the app deleted `sessionKey`, emptied `oauth:tokenCacheV2` and showed its sign-in
  screen. After Log out `lastKnownAccountUuid` still names the account that left, the
  `sessionKey` row is gone, and `oauth:tokenCacheV2` holds the same 28-character empty value
  as `oauth:tokenCache` (E1b). A switch from that state set 7 leftover items aside and put
  the other account back.
- The item list moves an account whole (E2): after a switch each way, the name,
  conversations, Code tab, Cowork and connectors were the right account's, with nothing of
  the other. One account had no `File System`, so an item on the list may be absent.
- The `sessionKey` ciphertext keeps its fingerprint across quitting and opening the app, for
  both accounts (E3). Only the analytics cookie `_dd_s_v2` changed.
- `lastKnownAccountUuid` is written while the app runs, 35 and 15 seconds after launch on two
  sign-ins, before `sessionKey` reaches the jar at 63 and 31 seconds (E4). The jar is flushed
  about every 30 seconds. Both sign-ins started with no uuid in `config.json`, so whether a
  sign-in replaces the uuid that Log out leaves behind (E1b) was read from the bundle
  instead, on 5 October 2026 (below).
- A cookie is AES-128-CBC with a key from PBKDF2-SHA1 of the item's password, salt
  `saltysalt`, 1003 rounds, 16 bytes, an IV of sixteen 0x20 bytes, and from meta version 24
  a 32-byte SHA-256 of the host before the value (E5). A `sessionKey` decrypted this way was
  accepted by claude.ai. The item's account is `Claude Key`.
- At quit the app writes `Cookies`, `config.json`, `Local Storage`, `Session Storage`,
  `WebStorage` and `Preferences`, each with the mtime of the second the main process exited
  (E8).
- `oauth:tokenCache` and `oauth:tokenCacheV2` are keyed
  `acct:<lastKnownAccountUuid>|...:<org>:https://api.anthropic.com:<scopes>` and hold
  `token`, `refreshToken`, `expiresAt`, `subscriptionType` and `rateLimitTier` (E9): 1668
  and 1732 characters for one account, 28 and 1500 for the other. These and
  `lastKnownAccountUuid` are the three keys a switch moves, and with the items on the list
  they were enough to move each of two accounts whole (E2). Nobody went through the file's
  other keys one by one to show none of them follows the account.
- `GET claude.ai/api/organizations/<lastActiveOrg>/usage` with the `sessionKey` cookie
  answers 200 with `five_hour` and `seven_day`, each with `utilization` and `resets_at`
  (E10). The history's `fh` and `sd` matched it: 0% and 1% against 0% and 1% for one
  account, 30% and 5% against 30% and 5% for the other, so history readings are verified.
- Nothing ran from the bundle 0, 2, 5 and 30 seconds after a quit but `chrome-native-host`
  (E12), and no crashpad handler or helper was left when the main process exited (E18).
- The app keeps no `SingletonLock`, in its data folder or in `$TMPDIR`, while it runs; its
  main process holds the `LOCK` files of its leveldb stores instead (E14). The lock check
  finds nothing, and the process scan is the only sign the app is open.
- claude.ai answered a request with the user agent `pitboard/<version>` with 200 and no bot
  check (E15). `GET claude.ai/api/account` answers `email_address`, `uuid`, `full_name`,
  `display_name` and `memberships` (E17); Pitboard does not ask it yet, so a Claude Desktop
  account shows no email.
- Always Allow left the key's `cdat` and `mdat` at 20260727084307Z (U-K1). Before it, a
  background shell's read exited 36; after it, the same shell read the key without a
  question (U-K1b), so refreshes need nobody at the Mac. Reads over ssh or from a launchd
  job were not tried.
- `security` exits 128 on Deny, and 128 too when a wrong password is typed and Allow chosen;
  51 was never seen (U-K2). Killing it with SIGTERM (exit 143) leaves the question on screen
  (U-K3), so a read that times out can leave a dialog behind. A refresh that timed out does
  not ask again for the same stamp, but that gate is per process: every `enable` asks, and
  two processes refreshing at once can each leave one. Reading the item's attributes
  without `-w` never prompted, many times from a background shell (U-K5).

Read on 5 October 2026, from the same build:

- The app replaces an account's `sessionKey` without signing it out. A session Pitboard had
  just put back met `session_stale_relogin` a second after launch, and 66 seconds later a
  new `sessionKey` was created under the same `lastKnownAccountUuid`, with no
  `Login-state transition` in `main.log`.
- A sign-in replaces a `lastKnownAccountUuid` that Log out left behind. `app.asar` writes
  the key whenever the account the page reports differs from the one read at launch, the
  same write E4 timed where none was named. So a session Pitboard has not seen under a uuid
  it knows is that account's; a session Pitboard knows as another account's still stops
  with `desktop_identity_unconfirmed`.

Not measured yet, and dated `UNVERIFIED` in the register:

- Whether the session's expiry slides forward with use (E11, E13). Both sessions read on 4
  October 2026 expire on 1 November 2026, so the read that settles it comes after that.
- Whether reads with Always Allow slow the app down (U-K6; U-K1 read only the stamp), and
  whether an update of the app keeps the item (U-K4).

Not in the register, because Pitboard checks it rather than assumes it: whether the data
folder and `~/.pitboard` share a volume on other Macs (E7). Every switch checks it.
