# pitboard

Switch between your own Claude Code, Codex and Claude Desktop logins, and see how much each
one has left.

With two or more Claude or ChatGPT subscriptions, changing accounts in Claude Code or
OpenAI's Codex CLI means a sign-out and a browser sign-in. pitboard keeps the login of
each account you are not using, called a parked login. A switch puts the chosen account's
parked login where the tool reads it.

Only the account changes: your history, sessions, settings and projects stay where they are.
A Claude Code session that is already open picks up a switch within about 33 seconds. A
running `codex` keeps the old account until you restart it.

On macOS, pitboard also switches Claude Desktop, Anthropic's app. Its login is a set of
files in Claude's data folder, so a switch moves those files into a park while Claude is
closed, and leaves the rest of the folder alone. The menu bar app quits Claude for a switch
and opens it again. pitboard is not affiliated with Anthropic, and Claude Desktop does not
document any of this. pitboard's facts about it were read from a named version of the app
and measured on it, and the four not yet measured, such as whether a session's expiry moves
while it is used, are marked as such.

pitboard sends a login only to the service that issued it: Anthropic for Claude Code, OpenAI
for Codex, and claude.ai for Claude Desktop's live usage, which is off until you turn it on.
It has no server of its own and no telemetry, and parked logins stay on your computer. For
every request, including the app's update check on GitHub, see
[What leaves your machine](https://docs.usepitboard.com/security#what-leaves-your-machine).

pitboard is pre-release. macOS is tested. On Linux, pitboard builds and its tests pass, but
it has not been run with a real signed-in Claude Code or Codex.

## Install

```sh
brew install datlechin/tap/pitboard            # the command line, macOS and Linux
brew install --cask datlechin/tap/pitboard-app # the menu bar app, macOS 14 or later
```

The app includes the command line and keeps both up to date, so install one or the other.
Neither needs Rust. Without Homebrew, use one of these:

- With [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) installed,
  `cargo binstall pitboard` fetches the release's command line for your machine.
- The [latest release](https://github.com/datlechin/pitboard/releases/latest) has the
  command line for macOS and Linux, on x86_64 and aarch64, and the app. To check a file, use
  `gh attestation verify <file> --repo datlechin/pitboard`, as
  [Verify a download](https://docs.usepitboard.com/install/verify) explains.
- `cargo install --locked pitboard` builds it from source, with Rust 1.91 or later and a C
  compiler. Without `--locked`, Cargo ignores the `Cargo.lock` pitboard was released with
  and may pick newer dependencies.

If Homebrew installed pitboard up to 0.3.0, follow
[Upgrade from 0.3.0 or earlier](https://docs.usepitboard.com/install/upgrade-from-0-3-0).
From the old app cask, `brew update` replaces the app with the command line.

Run `pitboard uninstall` before you remove pitboard, as
[Remove pitboard](https://docs.usepitboard.com/install/remove) describes. Removing the
program alone leaves its parked logins, the daily renewal schedule and `~/.pitboard` behind.

## Quickstart

First enrol the account Claude Code is signed in to, then the others:

```sh
pitboard enroll personal        # the account Claude Code is signed in to
pitboard enroll work --sign-in  # another one, through Claude Code's own sign-in
pitboard                        # what each account has left
pitboard use work               # switch Claude Code to work
```

Before the switch, `pitboard` shows each account and what it has left. Once pitboard has
read an account a few times, a last line under it says how long the account lasts:

```text
● personal  me@example.com  signed in
    5h    ██████░░░░   59%  resets in 1h 10m
    week  ███████░░░   73%  resets in 5d 18h
          about 48m left at this rate

○ work      me@company.com  ready · good for 26d 4h
    5h    █░░░░░░░░░   12%  resets in 3h 02m
    week  ████░░░░░░   40%  resets in 2d 4h
          resets in 3h 02m
```

For Codex, put `codex/` before each label: `pitboard enroll codex/personal`,
`pitboard enroll codex/work --sign-in`, `pitboard use codex/work`.

For Claude Desktop, quit Claude first, then put `desktop/` before each label. To add a
second account, park the first and leave Claude signed out, sign in to the other account in
Claude, quit it, and enrol that one:

```sh
pitboard enroll desktop/personal  # the account Claude Desktop is signed in to
pitboard use desktop --signed-out # park it, and leave Claude signed out
pitboard enroll desktop/work      # after you sign in to work in Claude and quit it
pitboard use desktop/personal     # switch Claude Desktop back to personal
```

Never use Log out in Claude Desktop to switch or to add an account. It ends that session at
claude.ai, and pitboard cannot bring it back; `pitboard use desktop --signed-out` parks the
login instead. [Use pitboard with Claude Desktop](https://docs.usepitboard.com/guides/claude-desktop)
has each step, and what a parked Claude Desktop login cannot do.

Do not add an account with Claude Code's `/login` or with `codex login`. Both replace the
login in use without pitboard parking it, so the account that was in use needs a browser
sign-in again. `codex login` also revokes the login it replaces.

To switch in the menu bar app, click pitboard's item in the menu bar, then choose the
account. For each step and what it prints, see the
[Quickstart](https://docs.usepitboard.com/quickstart).
