//! `pitboard statusline`: one line for Claude Code's status bar, naming the account in use
//! and what every enrolled account has left.
//!
//! Claude Code runs it after every message with its session as JSON on stdin, including the
//! limits of the account that session is using, and on a timer too when its settings ask.
//! So this reads only files, with no keychain and no network, and writes two. What the
//! session passed is kept for its next run to compare with, and what moved since its last
//! run goes into Pitboard's readings as the account in use's, where it can be that
//! account's; they keep it only where it is newer than what they have. The account in use
//! shows its reading with that folded in, so a session left open shows what the busy ones
//! have recorded since. The other accounts show Pitboard's last reading of them, with its
//! age once that is worth knowing.
//!
//! It is Claude Code's status bar, so it is about Claude Code's accounts and nothing else.
//! The account in use is the one Claude Code's own record names, looked up among Claude
//! Code's accounts only, and the others listed are the ones this session could be switched
//! to. A Codex account is neither, whatever its label or its identity happens to be.
