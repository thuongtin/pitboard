//! How often pitboard is allowed to ask Anthropic about an account.
//!
//! `status` asked about every enrolled account plus the live login on every run, with no
//! memory of having just asked, and the menu bar app asked the same questions every five
//! minutes, on every wake, and on every panel open, from a process that knew nothing about
//! the command line's. Nothing honoured `Retry-After`: a 429 became a stale row and the
//! identical request went out on the next tick. Two accounts and a running app is on the
//! order of six hundred authenticated requests a day that nobody asked for.
//!
//! Beyond the cost, that is the part of pitboard's behaviour that reads least like a person
//! switching between their own accounts, which is the one appearance this project cannot
//! afford.
//!
//! So there is a floor, and it is derived rather than chosen: an account may be asked again
//! once its tightest limit could have moved by one percentage point. A five-hour window
//! moves at most 100% in five hours, so that is three minutes; a weekly window, a hundred.
//! Whatever the floor is, it is far below what changes anybody's decision, and it collapses
//! the repeated asking to one request per account per few minutes however many front ends
//! are running.
//!
//! Nothing here is secret. It is names, times and counts.
