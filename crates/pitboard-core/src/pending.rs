//! Names pitboard is about to write a login into, written down before the login is.
//!
//! The switch got this right and nothing else did. `enroll --sign-in` and the renewal that
//! runs inside every `pitboard status` both claimed a name, wrote a login into it, and only
//! then recorded it, with cleanup that runs when a step returns an error and never when a
//! run is killed. Killed in that window, the machine keeps a live refresh token that no
//! entry in `state.json` names: never renewed, never offered, not removed by
//! `pitboard uninstall`, and on macOS not listable by any tool the user has, because
//! `security find-generic-password` takes no wildcard.
//!
//! So every name is written here first and resolved by the next command. This is an index,
//! not a vault: it holds names, never a token.
