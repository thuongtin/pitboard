//! What each account's limits have been doing, rather than only what they are now.
//!
//! The single decision Pitboard exists to support is which account to use next, and it
//! answered with two instantaneous percentages and left the arithmetic to the person. 73%
//! of a weekly limit means nothing without knowing whether it was 40% this morning. An
//! account at 60% with four hours until its window resets is better than one at 40% with
//! twenty minutes, and better again than one at 20% whose weekly limit resets on Sunday.
//!
//! Pitboard already had the data and threw it away: one snapshot per account in a map that
//! every write replaced. This keeps the series instead, one line per reading, and derives
//! from it the only number that answers the question: how long this account lasts.
//!
//! Nothing here is secret. It is percentages and times.
//!
//! Sized before it was written: one reading is 319 bytes, and a machine running `pitboard`
//! and a status line writes several an hour. So a reading is only appended when the last
//! one is old enough or the number has actually moved, and anything older than a fortnight
//! goes when the file is next written.
