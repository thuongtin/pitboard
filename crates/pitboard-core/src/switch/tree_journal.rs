//! Finishing or undoing what an interrupted move of a folder login started.
//!
//! A tree switch writes this record before it moves anything, naming every item it may
//! move by the inode it has on each side. Which way recovery goes is decided by the state
//! alone: until the outgoing account's park is recorded there, the run is undone, item for
//! item back where it was; once it is, the run is finished. Every item is judged before any
//! is moved, by its inode, so an item found where neither side put it stops recovery with
//! nothing changed, and is never guessed at. Whatever the app made in the meantime is set
//! aside in the strays directory, never deleted, and recovery waits while the app is open.
