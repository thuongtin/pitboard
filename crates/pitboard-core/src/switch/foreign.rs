//! Parked logins `repair` gave back that this pitboard never wrote.
//!
//! On macOS every `PITBOARD_HOME` shares the login keychain, so a park this home never wrote
//! down may be another pitboard's. Giving one back to the account whose name it carries is
//! additive and safe; what was not safe was what followed. Once given back it was this
//! home's to delete, so the next switch away from its account, a forget or an uninstall
//! deleted another pitboard's parked login. Now only using one deletes it. Every case runs
//! for both tools, because who wrote a park is a fact about the store and not about a tool.
//! Off macOS the vault is a directory inside the home, which no other pitboard parks in, so
//! there a park `repair` finds is this pitboard's own.
