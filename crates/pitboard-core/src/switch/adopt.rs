//! Taking over a Pitboard directory that another machine wrote.
//!
//! The machine stamp is right and the reason for it is sound: a parked login is a refresh
//! token, and two machines taking turns presenting one makes Claude Code drop the login on
//! both. What was wrong was the shape of the refusal. Every command reads the state, so a
//! stamp that does not match stopped all of them, including `uninstall` and, in effect,
//! `doctor`. A person who buys a new Mac and lets Migration Assistant bring their home and
//! their keychain across arrives at a tool that will not do anything at all, with an error
//! telling them to enrol their accounts again and no command that makes that possible.
//!
//! So this is that command. It keeps everything that is a fact about an account rather than
//! about a machine: the label, the email, the account and organisation uuid, and the
//! numbers Pitboard remembers. It drops every parked login, because a login is the one
//! thing that does not move. The way back is one sign-in per account.
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do is ask Anthropic whether a parked token still works.
//! Finding out means exchanging it, and exchanging it is exactly the act that would rotate
//! it past the other machine's copy. Until someone has measured, on a throwaway account and
//! two machines, whether an exchange invalidates the copy the other machine holds, there is
//! no safe probe and the honest default is to drop the login and say so.
