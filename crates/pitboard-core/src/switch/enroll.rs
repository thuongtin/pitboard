//! Bringing an account under pitboard's care.
//!
//! A parked copy is only safe if the live slot is replaced the moment it is taken; otherwise
//! the tool keeps rotating the same token and the copy goes stale, and for a tool whose
//! sign-out revokes what it finds, a copy left beside the live login is one the person's
//! own next sign-out would end. So the account signed in now is recorded but not parked.
//! Its first switch parks it at exactly that moment, and any other account is signed in
//! inside a private directory, where the live slot is never touched and the vault is the
//! new login's only holder.
//!
//! A sign-in to the account signed in now keeps the same rule. That account is not parked,
//! so its new login is put in use the way a switch puts one there, in place of the old.
