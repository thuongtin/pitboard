//! Claude's key in the keychain, `Claude Safe Storage`, which Chromium encrypts the app's
//! cookies with.
//!
//! The item's access list trusts Claude and nothing else, so reading its password makes
//! macOS ask the person at the Mac whether Pitboard may. That question is asked once, when
//! somebody turns live usage on, and never again from a refresh: a refresh that would have
//! to ask gives up after ten seconds and says approval is needed. Giving up does not take
//! the question away: experiment U-K3 found macOS keeps it on screen after `security` is
//! killed, so a refresh that gave up never asks again for the same key. That holds within
//! one process: `enable` asks every time it runs, and two processes refreshing at once can
//! each ask, so each of those can leave a question behind. After Always Allow a background
//! shell that could not ask before reads the key without asking (experiment U-K1b), so
//! refreshes from there need nobody at the Mac; a read over SSH or from a scheduled job has
//! not been measured. Reading the item's attributes
//! asks nothing (the register's `security_attributes_never_prompt`, experiment U-K5), which
//! is how a key Claude made again is noticed without its password being read.
//!
//! Every read goes through `/usr/bin/security`, like every other keychain read Pitboard
//! makes, and is never written: the item is Claude's. Running it is the host's, in
//! `host/macos/safe_storage.rs`; what a read means is said here.
