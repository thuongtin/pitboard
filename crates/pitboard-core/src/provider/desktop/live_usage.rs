//! Live usage: Claude Desktop's usage asked of claude.ai with the app's own session, which
//! takes Claude's key out of the keychain. Off until somebody turns it on.
//!
//! The key opens every session on the machine, and reading it can put macOS's question in
//! front of somebody. So only [`enable`], which somebody asked for, ever reads it in a way
//! that may ask; every other read gives up after ten seconds. A refusal, a question nobody
//! answered, an item that is gone or an answer `security` is not known to give is a reason
//! to wait to be allowed again rather than ask on every refresh; a session that cannot show
//! the question, or an item whose attributes cannot be read for a moment, says nothing
//! about approval and changes none. The key is
//! read at most once per process for each version of the keychain item, and a version
//! Pitboard was not allowed is never read.
//!
//! A read that gives up leaves macOS's question on screen (experiment U-K3), so waiting to
//! be allowed after one is what keeps a refresh in the same process from stacking a second
//! question on the first; another process, or another `enable`, can still ask. After Always
//! Allow a background shell read the key without asking (U-K1b), so refreshes need nobody
//! there.

// Turned on and off by the service and asked by status, which this file is the boundary for.
