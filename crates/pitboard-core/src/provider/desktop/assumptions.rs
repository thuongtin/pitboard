//! Every fact about Claude Desktop that pitboard stands on, named and dated.
//!
//! Read from Claude Desktop 2.19675.0 on a Mac on 3 October 2026: its bundle, its data
//! folder, its cookie database copied aside, its processes and its keychain item's
//! attributes. The experiments of 4 October 2026, run on the same build with two real
//! accounts, settled most of the rest, each entry naming the experiment (E1 to E18 for the
//! app, U-K1 to U-K5 for the keychain). Four facts still wait for a read: whether the
//! session's expiry slides, whether a sign-in replaces a uuid Log out left behind, whether
//! reading the key slows the app, and whether an update keeps the keychain item. Each is dated [`UNVERIFIED`] and names the experiment that will
//! settle it. Code that can choose between two behaviours on one asks
//! [`crate::assumptions::verified`] first; code that cannot work at all without one leans on
//! it as written, and `pitboard doctor` lists it as unverified.
//!
//! Nothing here can be probed for in a build: the app's literals are in `app.asar`, not in
//! its Mach-O binary, so every entry has an empty probe.
//!
//! See [`crate::assumptions`] for what an entry means.
