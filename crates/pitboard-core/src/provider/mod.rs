//! The boundary between pitboard's own machinery and one particular coding tool's login.
//!
//! pitboard was written against Claude Code, and for a long time that was the whole of it:
//! the keychain slot hashing, the five keys a logout deletes, the write lock and its
//! constants, the config file whose identity cache has to be spliced after a switch. None
//! of that is a fact about parking a login. It is a fact about Claude Code.
//!
//! This module names the small set of things that genuinely differ between one tool and
//! the next, so the rest of the crate can stop knowing which tool it is serving.
//!
//! # What is here and what deliberately is not
//!
//! Five operations: read the live credential, learn whose it is, measure what it has left,
//! renew it, install it. Every one of them is something the engine has to call without
//! caring how it is done underneath, and every one was checked against all three tools'
//! measured shapes before it was written down rather than derived from Claude Code alone.
//! [`Provider::usage`] takes the whole credential and the context rather than a bare access
//! token for exactly that reason: Gemini's quota call needs a project id out of a second
//! file that has nothing to do with the token, and a signature that looked sufficient after
//! Claude and Codex would have been wrong.
//!
//! Three facts, as values rather than code paths: [`Adoption`], [`ParkSemantics`],
//! [`Isolation`]. These are things the engine and the front ends must branch on, and a
//! value lets them branch on the fact instead of on the provider's name. Nothing anywhere
//! should read `if provider == Claude`.
//!
//! Four pure functions over a login document: which part of it belongs to the account,
//! how to put another account's part in, a non-secret handle on its refresh token, and when
//! it stops working. These are here because pitboard's own bookkeeping needs them and they
//! are genuinely different per tool: Claude Code's login sits in a document the machine
//! shares with unrelated keys, while Codex and Gemini keep one account per file. They were
//! not in the first sketch of this trait, which is how it came to be a boundary nothing
//! could actually park through.
//!
//! What is not here: a `park` method. Parking is pitboard's own bookkeeping, built out of
//! the pieces above, and a method for it would have to hide the difference between splicing
//! a shared document and replacing a whole file behind a flag. Also absent: Claude Code's
//! config-file identity cache, its supervisor daemon, its status line hook. A method most
//! implementations no-op is a sign it does not belong on a shared trait.
